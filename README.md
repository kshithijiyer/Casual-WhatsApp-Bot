# Experimental

- Experimental project
- Required Twilio Account
- install twilio `pip install twilio`

# TODO

- Add instructions to run
- I am sorry, but right now I just finished this project and pushed it.
- For starters, activate the shell
    - `activate myvenv/bin/activate`
- This should run your project on port `3000` or `5000`
- I will also add documentation to publish on `heroku`, once I am complete with this

# Boilerplate

- Consider this as a template
